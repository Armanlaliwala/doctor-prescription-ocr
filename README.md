# 🩺 Doctor Prescription OCR

**Doctor Prescription OCR** is a lightweight OCR application that extracts handwritten text from scanned or photographed medical prescriptions using [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR). It provides a simple, user-friendly interface via [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to upload an image and view extracted text.

> ⚠️ This project currently performs best on prescriptions with **good handwriting** and clear image quality.
